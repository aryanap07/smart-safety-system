The Smart Safety System is designed to encourage early hazard detection and provide instant alerts.
By combining a temperature sensor (LM35) and a gas/smoke sensor, it helps build a safer environment and demonstrates how simple electronics can solve real-world problems.

This project aims to be:

Beginner-friendly

Practical

Educational

Reliable for basic safety monitoring

🛠️ Key Features

✔ Real-time LCD display for temperature & gas readings
✔ LED + Buzzer alert system
✔ Separate warnings for temperature & gas
✔ Combined alert when both thresholds cross
✔ Works on Arduino UNO & Tinkercad
✔ Clean and easy-to-understand code
